## Prompt

PeachyTasks has gained a lot of users and they've started requesting new features and reporting bugs. You are to fix the defects and implement any new features as specified, according to provided mockups.

All work should be done on the frontend only â€” **do not modify the API**.

### Bug: "done" tasks list not updating with changes

When a user marks a task as "done" it should be shown under "Done" tasks without refreshing the page.

### Feature: Trash

Users need a way to move tasks they don't need anymore to the trash.

- Add "trash" button to each Task; when clicked:
  - DELETE `/api/tasks/${id}` to move the Task to the trash
  - Update task lists to reflect new API state
- Add "trash" menu item to the top navigation
  - Shows count of tasks in the trash
  - On click, show a modal with information about the trash
    - List all tasks in the trash
      - GET `/api/trash` to list tasks in the trash
    - Include "empty trash" button; when clicked:
      - DELETE `/api/trash` to empty the trash
      - Update task lists + trash to reflect new API state
      - Dismiss the modal
